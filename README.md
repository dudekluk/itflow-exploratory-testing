<h1 id="Test-plan">Test plan for ITFlow exploratory testing.</h1>

### Description:
This project aims to verify the functionality and UX of the [ITFlow](https://itflow.org/) website through a combination of exploratory and manual functional testing. Main focus of the tests are: core user functionalities like login, registration, admin panel, ticketing, and billing. Testing will be conducted on a Windows 11 desktop machine using Google Chrome, Brave, and Internet Explorer to ensure compatibility across different browsers. Additionally, basic checks for security vulnerabilities and accessibility compliance will be included to assess overall user experience and system robustness.

### Scope of Testing:

- **Functional Testing**:
  * Verify core functionalities such as login, registration, admin panel access, ticketing, billing, client management, and data management.
  * Ensure accurate data processing.
  * Test various input combinations and edge cases.
  * Validate error handling and feedback messages.

- **Usability Testing**:
  * Evaluate the user interface design.
  * Assess the ease of navigation and workflow.
  * Identify any usability issues.
    
- **Compatibility Testing**:
  * Ensure compatibility with different browsers, operating systems, and devices.
  * Test responsiveness on various screen sizes and resolutions.
    
- **Security Testing**:
  * Identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
  * Test authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Testing Environment:

- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (Desktop machine)
- **Browser**: Google Chrome, Brave, Internet Explorer (IE)
  

### Test Schedule:
* **Start Date**: 10.10.2024
* **End Date**: 24.10.2024 

### Resources:

- **Manual tester**: Responsible for exploratory testing and creating test data.
- **Tools**: 
   * Faker 
   * DevTools
   * ShareX and ScreenPal
   * BugMagnet

### Entry Criteria:
- Smoke tests are performed and the code is stable for testing.
- Test environment is set up and ready.
- Test plan is reviewed, and approved.
- Test data are designed.
  
  

### Exit Criteria:

- All tests from the check list are executed.
- All critical and major defects should be fixed or have a solution plan.
- Test coverage should be at least 80%.
- Test summary report is ready.

### Risks and Mitigations:
- **Risk**: Changes in requirements or specifications during testing.
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain constant contact with the product owner and monitor documentation changes.
- **Risk**: Lack of testers knowledge.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure proper training and development to improve testing skills of team members.
- **Risk**: Delays in test execution.
  - **Mitigation**:  Prioritize critical test cases and conduct proper time estimation to avoid delays.
